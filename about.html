          <p id="descirption">EcoAutokoulu is a driving school based in Espoo, Finland. We have been in business for over 20 years. We have many successful students who have come to us as beginner drivers, but also as experienced drivers wanting to learn to pass their international driving permit test. Our teaching methods are based on modern and practical driving theories of skill learning and skills development. We always focus on combining fun with learning and teaching at the same time.<p><br>
          <p>It's easy to drive in the city when we teach you how. You can either take the test for driver's license (getting a car license is encouraged but not mandatory) or just get some general driving experience. If you need the car license, you'll get the test at a later time. If you just want some fun driving lessons, you could get the test here and not return for years. The school is close to the centre of Espoo, a city with a population of 260 000.</p>
